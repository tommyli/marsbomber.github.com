Template copied from [TJ Stein](https://github.com/bummercloud/tjstein.com).

The site is powered by Jekyll and built on mostly valid HTML5 and CSS3. Posts are in markdown.

The only plugin I use currently is for pagination so you'll need the jekyll-pagination (0.0.3) gem.

<pre>gem install jekyll-pagination</pre>
