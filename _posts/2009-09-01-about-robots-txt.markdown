A while ago, I was asked the question of how we can tell search engine spiders how and where to search and index our site. We know the answer is robots.txt. Placing this special file under your site root will do the trick. I've been handcrafting the robots.txt file since I know its existence until I recently found there are generators out there can help you with the job ... silly me!

To save you some time, <a href="http://www.mcanerin.com/en/search-engine/robots-txt.asp" target="_blank">http://www.mcanerin.com/en/search-engine/robots-txt.asp</a> is what I use now.
