It's been another year. 2010 is at its end. Now it's time to review my 2010 resolutions and set goals for 2011.

Goals I set for 2010. Half are achieved.

I ended up having no time to make a Titanium mobile app nor a RoR pet project. This was partly caused by me starting a new job in July. As for the house, I did get a mower for the lawn. However nothing's done to the house itself. We might just leave it as it, and do something major to it later on (maybe 2012).
<ol>
	<li><del datetime="2010-12-28T09:10:27+00:00">Take a get-away holiday. It’s been almost 4 years since my last proper holiday. My wife deserves better …</del></li>
	<li><del datetime="2010-12-28T09:10:27+00:00">Cutback on freelancing and spend more time with family, especially my son, Oscar.</del></li>
	<li>Do something with the house please … paint the doors, replace the windows, fix up the deck and more importantly let’s mow the bloody lawn.</li>
	<li>Make one hobby mobile application using “Titanium”.</li>
	<li>Learn Ruby on Rails by writing one side project.</li>
	<li><del datetime="2010-12-28T09:10:27+00:00">Add a portfolio page to the ElinkMedia site.</del></li>
</ol>
Looking forward, following are the things I want to achieve in 2011.
<ol>
	<li>Work hard on my MYOB works. Make the project we're working on a big success!</li>
	<li>Work smart on my freelance works. Try getting recurring income.</li>
	<li>Rails 3 is out for a while now. I WILL make a pet RoR app this year!</li>
	<li>Get myself into Test Driven Development and study Behaviour Driven Development.</li>
	<li>Keep spending quality time with family. At least 2 road trips.</li>
	<li>Take over the duty of sending Oscar to his childcare (that is 3 mornings a week).</li>
</ol>
This is it. I'll see how I'm tracking throughout 2011.
