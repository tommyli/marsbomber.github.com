Hi, I'm Jim Li. I'm a programmer living in Melbourne and doing everything web and mobile related. I've been doing freelance work since 2005. I'm currently working full time at [ProjectProject](http://projectproject.com.au/ "ProjectProject"), a small but innovative digital focused brand development company.

Prior to joining ProjectProject, I worked as a senior developer at [MYOB](http://myob.com.au), [Agsmart](http://www.agsmart.com.au), and others.

In my free time, I enjoy reading, playing with my 3 year old boy and catching up with friends.
