I just finished listening to this ZendCon podcast. It's about some good practice tips in doing PHP development. They are quite basic, but I'm sure that not all PHP developers follow their suggestions ... At least I know I'm still some way apart from the suggested "Best Practices".

People, who are interested, can find it <a href="http://www.phppodcasts.com/2009/09/18/the-zendcon-sessions-episode-26-best-practices-of-php-development/" target="_blank">here</a>. To save you some time, the companion PDF slides can also be downloaded <a href="http://blog.elinkmedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/Best-Practices-of-PHP-Development.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.
