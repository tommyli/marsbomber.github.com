No need to mention, most of the web developers have long suffered from the chaotic but must-have JavaScript hand coding days ... I was "lucky" enough to learn JavaScript the hard way from my first job. Traversing the DOM was like a nightmare, repeating the same form validation 20 times, running into browser compatibility issues (tell me about it!!!), etc.

Tasks are made easy now with quite a number of JavaScript frameworks. I started with YUI, and now try to do more with jQuery. What I found with YUI is that I still need to write quite some code to do a task. On the other hand, with jQuery, I tend to write very little. I think this is because of the number of quality jQuery plug-ins. That's the same story with Firefox and its Addons.

Anyway, in most of my recent applications, I pretty much have the following plugins loaded in one minified .js file
<ul>
	<li>cmxform</li>
	<li>ajaxupload</li>
	<li>jquery.autocomplete</li>
	<li>jquery.metadata</li>
	<li>jquery-validate</li>
	<li>jquery-tablesorter</li>
</ul>
and of course the jQuery UI js combined with any necessary widgets.
