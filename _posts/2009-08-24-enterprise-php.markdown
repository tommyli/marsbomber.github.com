As my first blog post at the elink media blog, I want to start with a discussion on this "Enterprise PHP" topic.

Doing a search on Google, the most interesting posts are posted back in 2004 and 2005. You will find people taking about the strength and weaknesses of PHP, comparing with JAVA of course (enterprise de facto? pretty much).

This <a href="http://www.procata.com/blog/archives/2004/10/12/enterprise-php/" target="_blank">post</a> is particularly interesting, because of the writing itself and one of the user comments. Martin Fowler's enterprise application definition was quoted and used as a measurement to check if PHP is enterprise ready. According to Martin, PHP should be nowhere near his enterprise grade. However I found one of the replies (replied in 2004) actually matches what I always believe.

PHP will not fit in Martin Fowler's enterprise definition back in 2004, the statement is made and based on the enterprise definition defined long time ago. We know that IT moves world faster than ever. And I would say, web moves IT faster than ever too. This makes me question whether Martin Fowler's definition is still correct. Or has the definition of enterprise itself evolved over the past decade?

Having said that, I am a fan of Martin Fowler's enterprise design patterns. It helped me a lot with my jobs. If you've never come across him, I strongly recommend you do a Google search and read about his design patterns. Not saying you need to follow it, but at least you should be able to get some good ideas out of it.

Let's leave this as an open discussion. I'll discuss this further after I finish reading the "Zend Enterprise PHP Patterns" book I just bought.
