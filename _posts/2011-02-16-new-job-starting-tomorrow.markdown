I finished my last day’s work at MYOB and will be starting a new job tomorrow straight away.

It’s been a very interesting journey at MYOB for the last 7 months or so. The colleagues are not just very nice, but also very knowledgable in what they do. The product we’re building is exciting and challenging (and BIG, hopefully, it’ll be launched soon, and I can start talking about it!!!). My Zend Framework and Doctrine skills are exercised on a daily basis. Even better, MYOB’s Agile methodology adoption progress is applaudable. Having the whole business behind such a methodology is easy to say, but very hard to implement. Thumbs up!!!

Moving on to the new job at ProjectProject. Technically, it’s a whole new chapter for me. Ruby will be used over PHP. To me, this change is like having dinner with knives and forks instead of chopsticks. It’ll be a new set of tools to learn and master. Luckily at the new company, the business guys are adventurous and smart, the dev guys are nice and sharp. I’m sure I’ll learn heaps and contribute heaps from and to my new role.
