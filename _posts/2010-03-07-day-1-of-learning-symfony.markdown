Long weekend. I'll try to keep it short.

I'm a Zend Framework devotee. However Symfony is always on my to-learn list. I'm finally motivated today to give it a crack. Not to deny, a potential job lead also plays an important part in this.

I just spent the last 2 hours to download the library via SVN, follow the "Practical symfony" guide to setup a project and everything. All pretty straight forward. I'm on "Day 5" of the guide now. I'll stop here and finish the "tech" part of the day with this post (before my wife goes mad at me ...).

So, what do I think about Symfony?

People talk about the steep learning curve of studying Symfony, but I didn't find it's too hard to follow. I think this is because of 2 reasons. 1, I understand the MVC pattern pretty well from my Zend Framework projects. 2, Symfony has got heaps of similarity to Ruby on Rails and I have finished reading my RoR book at the start of the year.

I quite like the Symfony view helpers, the YAML style configurations, the out of the box modular approach and the command line generators.

If time allows, I'll blog more about Symfony in the future. For the next a couple of weeks or so, I might have to do some C#.Net for my next project.
