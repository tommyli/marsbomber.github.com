Doctrine 2 is in beta. It is for sure one of the most exciting things that caught my attention recently.

As a Zend Framework user, I started looking into ways to integrate Doctrine 2 with Zend Framework (currently in version 1).

The same as any other times, the solutions are already out there. The integration's already been done by Giorgio Sironi's nakedphp project.

So ... I borrowed code from nakedphp and put up a skeleton ZF projects myself.

My sample project is available on Github. You can find it <a href="http://github.com/marsbomber/zf1-doctrine2" target="_blank">here</a>.

Have a play, let me know if anything. Hope it'll help people like myself, who cannot wait to try out new and cool things.
