title: New years resolutions
---
Another year almost goes passed by. Time for doing this new years resolutions thing again.

Let's look back first, and see what I have accomplished in 2011.

* <del>Work hard on my MYOB works. Make the project we're working on a big success!</del>
* Work smart on my freelance works. Try getting recurring income.
* <del>Rails 3 is out for a while now. I WILL make a pet RoR app this year!</del>
* <del>Get myself into Test Driven Development and study Behaviour Driven Development.</del>
* <del>Keep spending quality time with family. At least 2 road trips.</del>
* <del>Take over the duty of sending Oscar to his childcare (that is 3 mornings a week).</del>

Okay! 5 out of 6 items are stiked out. Not too bad!

Now, look forward. In 2012, here are the things I want to make happen.

* I'll be re-joining MYOB and work on a new project. I want a big success on that!
* Keep working on freelance recurring income. I believe things will work out this year.
* Finish off my Rails 3 side project.
* Keep doing morning and afternoon childcare runs (3 days a week).
* Family time! Again, at least 2 family trips.

This is it! I'll see how things are tracking by the end of 2012!
