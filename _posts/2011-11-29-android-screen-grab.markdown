title: Android screen grab
---
I needed to publish an Android app for one of our clients today. Screenshots of the app is required for publishing.

To do it, extremely simple. 

* Get application onto testing Android device
* Connect Android device to computer, make sure device's debug mode is enabled.
* From the computer, start the DDMS program that's shipped with the Android SDK
* From DDMS, highlight the connected Android device, and go to menu "Device" - "Screen capture"

Not too hard. Have to say Apple's native screen capture feature on iOS devices is a lot simpler.
