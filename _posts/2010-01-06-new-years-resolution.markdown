It's 2010 and it's again time to set goals. It's important that the goals are realistic and achievable. So ... here they are
<ol>
	<li>Take a get-away holiday. It's been almost 4 years since my last proper holiday. My wife deserves better ...</li>
	<li>Cutback on freelancing and spend more time with family, especially my son, Oscar.</li>
	<li>Do something with the house please ... paint the doors, replace the windows, fix up the deck and more importantly let's mow the bloody lawn.</li>
	<li>Make one hobby mobile application using "Titanium".</li>
	<li>Learn Ruby on Rails by writing one side project.</li>
	<li>Add a portfolio page to the ElinkMedia site.</li>
</ol>
It really sounds like a relaxing year from the programming side. That's right! Family is this year's focus.

I'll keep updating this post and hopefully I can tick off all 6 items at the end of year 2010.

Happy new year!
