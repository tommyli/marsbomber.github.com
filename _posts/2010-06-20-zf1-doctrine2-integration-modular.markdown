This is a follow up post to my previous "<a href="http://blog.elinkmedia.net.au/2010/06/19/zf1-doctrine2-integration/">Zend Framework 1 and Doctrine 2 integration</a>".

I've created a new branch on my Github project "zf1-doctrine2". The "modular_setup" branch shows how we could setup Zend Framework with the modular approach, while still be able to use Doctrine 2 as the ORM for each module.

Oh well, the idea is to make each module decoupled with the rest of the application, so really, you could use whatever database handling mechanism in each module.

Check it out from my Github project <a href="http://github.com/marsbomber/zf1-doctrine2/tree/modular_setup" target="_blank">here</a>.
